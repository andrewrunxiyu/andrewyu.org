This is the code for my Gemini capsule. If there are any suggestions or
posts you would like to add, please fork this repository and send me a p
ull request.

If you are adding a post, be sure to run `python3 gen.py` in the `post`
directory in order to generate the index. Posts should be named like the
following, where YYYY is year, MM is month, DD is day, and the following
text is the post title with dashes (-) in place of spaces.
```
YYYY-MM-DD-The-quick-brown-fox-jumps-over-the-lazy-dog.gmi
```
