This is the code for my Gemini capsule. If there are any suggestions or
posts you would like to add, please fork this repository and send me a p
ull request.

If you are adding a post, be sure to run `python3 gen.py` in the `post`
directory in order to generate the index. Posts should be named with
dashes instead of spaces in the filename.
